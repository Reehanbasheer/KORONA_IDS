# KORONA_IDS
Korona IDS came up with an idea and also worked on to deploy an Network based Intrusion Detection system.
There project repository consist of checking the 
    1.Open number of ports for a given IP ranges 
    2.Verifying the MAC address with the stored database and sending a mail to the user, informing about the unauthorized access and it would also specify location such as the distance, longitude and latitude.
    3.Our system also consists of a GUI which has the server log and helps the admin to blacklist, de-authenticate and unblock the particular mac addresses as per requirements.
